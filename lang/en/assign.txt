====== Acknowledgement Assignments ======

Here you can define patterns to automatically assign people and groups to acknowledge certain pages.
Whenever a page matches one of the patterns here, the people and groups will be assigned.

  * Namespaces excluding subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:*</nowiki>''.
  * Namespaces including subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:**</nowiki>''.
  * Pages as usual with their full page ID.
  * Regular Expressions starting and ending with ''/'' - they are matched against a '':'' prefixed full page id.

Assignes are defined either by username or ''@'' prefixed group name. Multiple assignees are separated by commas '',''.
